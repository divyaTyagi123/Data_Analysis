set of 70000 small images of digit handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.
all images are labelled with the respective digit the y represent.
MNIST is the hello wolrd of the machine learning. 
there are 70000 images and each image has 784 features.
each image is 28X28 pixels and each feature simply represents one pixel's intensity from 0(white) to 255(black).
first 60000 images are used for training and the rest 10000 images are used for testing.

You're using x[36000], which tries to access column 36000 in a DataFrame x.

But you likely meant to access row number 36000, like from an image dataset (e.g., MNIST).
You should use .iloc to access rows by index position:
some_digit = x.iloc[36000]


 some_digit is a pandas Series, and Series objects don’t have a .reshape() method — it's a method for NumPy arrays.
 Convert the Series to a NumPy array first using .values or .to_numpy(), then reshape it.
